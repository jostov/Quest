Quest

This is a game that uses a server to calculate an intermediary point between several users.
The users are then prompted to race to that location, whoever gets there first is the winner.
This android stuff is just the client side information, but most of the calculations will actually
be done on the server, and ultimately, will probably be the only source code for this that I release.
